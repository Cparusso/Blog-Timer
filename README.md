Notes:

- Need to make it so that you cant type in a time that is over 60 seconds.

- If the forms are open when you hit reset timer it will change the timer back to 5:00 on the first reset click, and then go to the set time on the second reset click.

- Consider adding the functionality to adjust the warning time.

- It would be nice if you could hit spacebar to start/stop the timer

- Move the sound check button to the bottom right and change it from text to a sound related icon

- Clicking the form while the timer is ticking should pause the timer so that you can edit it
